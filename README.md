# polymer
This was a data science project that had multiple steps:
1. Scraping data from a polymer database website using Selenium and Beautiful Soup.
2. Cleaning and organizing the data so it was standardized.
3. Exploring the data to find relationships. Specifically, the objective was to identify crystalline polymers that could be used in structural composites in aerospace parts.
4. Feature engineering by using SMILES data (chemical structure in text form) to identify numeric values that could be used for machine learning.
5. Using PCA to reduce dimensionality, then using MiniSOM to cluster polymers.
6. Identifying polymers based on the results.
